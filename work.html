			<h2>Tab_P Chrome Extension</h2>
			<p>This is an extension I made for Google Chrome. It runs a fuzzy search across your tab titles and URLs and gives you a list ordered by how well your search term matches each tab. I used qs_score.js to run the query. This is meant to help folks who sometimes find themselves with too many tabs open. <a href="https://github.com/conorsg/tab_p" target="_blank">You can browse the source on Github</a> or add the extension via Chrome's Web Store:</p>

			<h2>&ldquo;No politics are local: dilemmas of American federalism,&rdquo; <em>Renewal</em> Vol 20, No 2/3, 2012</h2>
			<p>I published an article on American federalism in the post <em>Citizens United</em> age in the British journal for social democracy, <em>Renewal</em>. I looked at the 2011 Wisconsin recall election and how the old contest between state and federal power has been reconfigured by the influx of outside money in local politics.</p>
			<p>You can <a href="http://renewal.org.uk/issues/vol-20-no-2/3-2012/" target="_blank">read the article online if you or your institution have a subscription to <em>Renewal</em></a>. Otherwise, you can read draft copy:</p>

			<h2>Delaware Interfaith Power and Light</h2>
			<p>In 2011, I very happily helped Delaware's chapter of Interfaith Power and Light (an interfaith climate change action group) get themselves a website. It's a custom WordPress template with some email intergration using MailChimp's API. Nothing too fancy. Definitely need a good update. Nonetheless, it works well for the organization and has helped them grow in their first few years, so I'm proud.</p>

			<h2>Berrios Tax Cuts and Donors Map</h2>
			<p>As a researcher on Forrest Claypool's campaign for Cook Co Tax Assessor, I came into several decades of data on decisions our opponent, Joe Berrios, had made as to whose property taxes should be cut and whose should be maintained (Berrios sat on the three-person <a href="http://cookcountyboardofreview.com/" target="_blank">Cook Co Board of Review</a>). We found that 94% of donors to Berrios's campaigns saw their property taxes reduced, and that a small number of corportate firms who were the biggest donors to Berrios were also the biggest recipents of Berrios's largesse on the Board of Review.</p>
			<p>I made a map that shows which properties got tax cuts from Berrios. Each map marker pulls info on the attorney representing the property before Berrios, and how much this attorney or firm has donated to Berrios. The numbers show why the Better Gov't Association calls Berrios <a href="http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/October-2010/Joseph-Berrios-Candidate-for-Cook-County-Assessor-and-the-Ultimate-Political-Insider/" target="_blank">"pay-to-play personified."</a></p>
