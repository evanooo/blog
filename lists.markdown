_I am conflicted about the practice of curation, made ubiquitous and pushed to the extreme by the ease of the internet. However, I do believe in keeping records, and to this end I justify the following lists._

###Software I use###

 * [Notational Velocity](http://notational.net/) This is great, ultra-fast lightweight note taking software. I use it all the time, in class, in meetings, for planning. It's the best substitute for pen and paper.
 * [F.lux](http://stereopsis.com/flux/) Adjusts your screen hue at night so it's not so tiring to look at. _Not_ recommended for designers or anyone who has to know the correct colors on their screen.
 * [Handbrake](http://handbrake.fr/) Great video-ripping software. Check out some DVDs from your local library and start your own collection.
 * [Coconut Battery](http://www.coconut-flavour.com/) Shows your battery capacity change over time. For those of us who are compelled to see how our machines degrade.
 * [1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword) The best security for your online accounts is a good password.
 * [Spotify](http://open.spotify.com/user/lordzoldemort/playlist/1z33YBKBcLfM31kSk753aA) It's great. Especially the playlist this link goes to.
