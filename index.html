		<h2>&ldquo;Cool Dude&rdquo;</h2>

		<p>I'm a 26 year old from Lewes, Delaware and I can do a few things.</p>

		<p>Most recently, I was a frontend developer with <a href="http://www.barackobama.com">Barack Obama's re-election campaign.</a> It truly was an honor to be a part of this team. The small role I played involved CSS, JavaScript, some zingers, and a few microsites. <a href="mailto:conorsg@gmail.com">I'd be happy to talk more about it if you're interested.</a></p>

		<p>I also have some academic creds lurking around. I did a master's in 2011 in political thought and intellectual history at Cambridge. I wrote my dissertation on G.E. Moore and Wittgenstein, and how looking at some exchanges they had concerning logic clarifies differences in Wittgenstein's thought on logic and language between his early and late periods. <a href="/files/diss-excerpt.pdf">You can read an excerpt here.</a></p>

		<p>Recently, I also published an article on American federalism and the Wisconsin recall election in <em>Renewal</em>, an British journal for social democracy. <a href="http://renewal.org.uk/issues/vol-20-no-2/3-2012/">That can be found here.</a></p>

		<p>Choose below for the rest of my work as a web developer and researcher and to have any questions answered. Thanks!</p>
