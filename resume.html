			<h3>Frontend Developer, Sep - Nov 2012</h3>
			<p>I joined the frontend team for the end of the 2012 campaign. I worked mostly in CSS and JavaScript, and our group primarily handled state and constintuency pages. For our GOTV efforts, I helped get our election day volunteering app ready for prime time. Please <a href="mailto:conorsg@gmail.com">email me if you have specific questions about my work at OFA</a>.</p>

			<h3>MPhil in Political Thought and Intellectual History, Sep 2011 - June 2012</h3>
			<p>I took a master's degree from the history faculty at Cambridge in the spring of 2012. My research focused primarily on the history of early analytic philosophy, but I also did wrote about contemporary Anglophone historiography and Stanley Cavell. I wrote my dissertation on Ludwig Wittgenstein's philosophy of logic, in particular, how an understanding of his relationship with G.E. Moore can resolve some issues in the contemporary debate between the so-called resolute and standard readings of Wittgenstein's <em>Tractatus</em>.</p>

			<h3>Technology Associate, Feb - May 2011</h3>
			<p>As a staffer on Mayor-elect Rahm Emanuel's transition committee, I oversaw technology projects and helped develop strategy recommendations for the incoming administration. I helped a team of radical developers create an app that served as a community forum and solicited ideas from Chicagoans on specific policy issues. We built and launched it in six days. Ideas solicited through our app ended up in every section of the transition committee's formal recommendations to Mayor Emanuel.</p>

			<h3>Deputy New Media Director, Nov 2010 - Feb 2011</h3>
			<p>I handled a mess of digital-related tasks for the campaign. Most of my time was spent adding content to our website which used a Merb-based custom CMS. I wrote mostl in HTML, CSS, jQuery, and did some stuff with the Google Maps API. I also helped write and code our email blasts and did little "social media" tasks. Most importantly, we were coordinating all of these efforts to support the specific strategies and goals of the campaign's other departments.</p>

			<h3>Research Associate, Apr - Nov 2010</h3>
			<p>This was my first campaign. I joined as a field organizer collecting signatures to get our candidate on the ballot. After that, I was promoted to research associate. I made a lot of FOIA requests, did some elementary crunching of large datasets to get the skinny on tax cuts given by our opponent to his donors, and laid this information out on <a href="/claypoolmap.html">an interactive map</a>. Our research got picked up by a WGN investigation. I also made a negative campaign site, which was fun.</p>

			<h3>AB in <a href="http://fundamentals.uchicago.edu/" target="_blank">Fundamentals</a>, minor in Classical Studies, Sep 2004 - Dec 2008</h3>
			<p>Deets: <strong>GPA 3.8/4.0, College Honors, Deans List, Journalism Program Fellow.</strong></p>
			<p>I often get asked "What is Fundamentals?" It's a Great Books-like program. Undergrads apply in their first year and, if selected, they spend the next three years reading canonical Western texts and taking classes with a focus on their "fundamental question." Mine was "What does identity have to do with ethics?" and I took classes ranging from <em>Ulysses</em> to Microeconomics in the course of this wild goose chase. I wrote my thesis on identity and recognition in Homer's <em>Odyssey</em>. I also studied abroad in Vienna and was an intern with a news agency in Sarajevo.</p>
