title: Greece in 2012

Did I ever tell you about that time I went to Greece with my younger brother and some friends from college?

It all started the morning of June 6, when our dissertations were due. As previously arranged, I met two friends in the graduate research room (GRR), an elevated, 24-hour box of computers in the history faculty with free printing and all varieties of desperation. The atmosphere was faintly buzzing. I saw some coursemates who had not had to fortune to leave the GRR the night before, one smiling from behind empty bags of gummy bears and a stack of the classics of Western political thought from Montesquieu to Cohen. We printed our dissertations and walked to the graduate union to get them bound. It looked like it was going to rain. It didn't rain. Then it rained a little. We waited in the cafe at the union while our dissertations were bound. We had received an alarming email from the administration weeks earlier reminding us that June 6 was the Queen's jubilee and it was unclear how this would impact the paper binding in Cambridge. It was over quickly, and was inexpensive. 

It didn't rain as we walked back to the history faculty and handed our papers in. "Um, well done!" our course secretary told us. It was done. So I went home and stacked books to be returned to the library and put all the documents on my desktop into a folder called "MPhil." Then I cut across the cemetery to a pub to meet some friends. The nervous feeling of anti-climax wore off soon after the first drink and slow waves of relief began to roll in. It was nice to sit and talk to L-- and A-- about our feelings of frustration with the (perhaps unnecessarily) rushed process of writing a 20k word dissertation in one month. Is this what an academic career is going to be like? Surely not. It cannot be. We debated. And then, in a pathetic fallacy, it began to pour and there was thunder which is unusual anywhere in Britain. As the storm ended we realized we were quite drunk, quite exhausted, and nervous with something which I told myself was nervousness at having a lot of things to do now, but not knowing where or when to begin.

I did have a lot of things to do. I had to return my library books. I had to meet my younger brother the next morning in King's Cross, and the next day we were to fly to Athens to meet two friends of mine from college and begin a two week long vacation. I had to find us a place to stay for these two weeks. And I had to relax! I had to take it easy. I just finished a very grueling master's program. With all that in mind I anxiously went searching for my coursemates, the rest of them, at a pub across town. They were in the garden of the Granta, most of them, sitting in some shape inspired by a circle, vibrating at a high frequency. We drank some more and as we left the Granta around 7 pm for the Maypole, I peeled off to go home for a rest intending to join the group in a few hours for all-night carousing, but awoke only early the next morning on top of my bed, fully clothed with my shoes on.

On our way to Athens, Nat and I spent a dreadful six hours laid over in the Geneva airport, where Nat's bag decided to remain for the next two days. By some great stroke of luck, I found an extraordinary apartment in Athens for a great rate on AirBnb, and Heather, who had arrived many hours before me and Nat, was there to greet us when we arrived at 1:30 am. We were staying in a woman named Gina's apartment, in the neighborhood of Exarhia (ΕΞΑΡΧΙΑ), on a street that ran from Strefi Hill to Likavitos Hill. Exarhia, we were told, is "where every revolution in Greek history has ever begun." It governed itself, and when the police tried to come in the neighborhood to regulate protests and public gatherings, they were simply pushed out by the residents. We were in the right neighborhood at the right time, it appeared. All thirty-two factions of the Left seemed to have a presence in Exarhia. There were posters and graffiti everywhere, my favorite of which simply said "weg."

We spent a few days in Athens. Danielle and her friend from Beirut, Emma, met us and after some furious internet searching and creative negotiating, we found an apartment to stay in on the island of Poros and a way to get there. The apartment was owned by a young IT professional named Agamemnon who was also running for parliament as the leader of his own, newly founded party. He didn't seem to want to go into details about his party's platform, but after calling Syriza crazy he said we Americans would call his party a center-left party. I'm not sure if Agamemnon appreciated that center-left in America is pretty far-right everywhere else in the world. Maybe he did. He was good at negotiations. The resting state of the entire trip was one of mild logistical nightmare, and of course the leg in Agamemnon's island getaway provided no exception. Agamemnon, the keys to his place in Poros, and our merry band of travelers were all in Athens. However, the last ferry from Athens to Poros left at 6 pm, before Agamemnon could get out of work and deliver us his keys. We offered to stop by his work -- out of the question. He offered to get his mother to drop them off to us in Exarhia -- quickly eliminated. He finally suggested that our group split into two, half taking the last ferry from Athens, and half going with him to Poros by car and a later ferry from the Peloponnese. It worked. In extreme vacation _geist_, Heather, Nat, and I waited on the quayside in Poros town sipping white wine and watching the sun set while Danielle, and Emma were hurtling towards us across the Peloponnese in Agamemnon's car.

We picked Poros at random from Athens, but ended up lucking out. The island is mostly frequented by Greeks and is largely passed over in Lonely Planets and other guidebooks which shunt the worst of the globetrotting late-capitalist imperialists to other islands like Santorini and Mykonos. It was suitably quiet for our group and Agamemnon's apartment was close to two very nice beaches: Love Bay and Russian Bay. The night before I left the UK for Greece, a friend who had been several times told me that the climate and landscape in Greece are the most remarkable aspects of the country, and the landscape feels hospitable in an elemental way that gives all those dangerously essential claims about the birthplace of Western civilization some new dimension that must be contended with. It is a romantic place, and not just because there are beaches named Love Bay. Giorgos Seferis knows what I mean:

<blockquote>
	<p><em><a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/181958" target="_blank">Mythistorema 7</a></em></p>
	<p>Westward the sea merges with a mountain range.<br>
	From our left the south wind blows and drives us mad,<br>
	the kind of wind that strips bones of their flesh.<br>
	Our house among pines and carobs.<br>
	Large windows. Large tables<br>
	for writing you the letters we’ve been writing<br>
	so many months now, dropping them<br>
	into the space between us in order to fill it up.</p>
	<p>Star of dawn, when you lowered your eyes<br>
	our hours were sweeter than oil<br>
	on a wound, more joyful than cold water<br>
	to the palate, more peaceful than a swan’s wings.<br>
	You held our life in the palm of your hand.<br>
	After the bitter bread of exile,<br>
	at night if we remain in front of the white wall<br>
	your voice approaches us like the hope of fire;<br>
	and again this wind hones<br>
	a razor against our nerves.</p>
	<p>Each of us writes you the same thing<br>
	and each falls silent in the other’s presence,<br>
	watching, each of us, the same world separately<br>
	the light and darkness on the mountain range<br>
	and you.<br>
	Who will lift this sorrow from our hearts?<br>
	Yesterday evening a heavy rain and again today<br>
	the covered sky burdens us. Our thoughts –<br>
	like the pine needles of yesterday’s downpour<br>
	bunched up and useless in front of our doorway —<br>
	would build a collapsing tower.</p>
	<p>Among these decimated villages<br>
	on this promontory, open to the south wind<br>
	with the mountain range in front of us hiding you,<br>
	who will appraise for us the sentence to oblivion?<br>
	Who will accept our offering, at this close of autumn?</p>
</blockquote>

We spent four days on Poros. On one day, we took a ferry to Hydra. Hydra was rich during the 18th and 19th centuries. It had some fancy shipbuilders, a few admirals, and other big shots in the Ottoman navy. The island has a lot of beautiful old mansions, no cars, and not a few donkeys. By donkeys I mean the equine and the type of American tourist who thinks it's neat or something to busk around Europe. We hightailed it out of Hydra town to a nearby beach once the crusty buskers discovered each other and began busking back and forth in some facile display of liberated spirits. Despite Hydra's beautiful streetscapes and total lack of cars, there was a bit too much English spoken for our taste (and spoken on too limited a range of subjects: "I got so wasted last night," "Before you say anything, let me remind you I am wasted," "Do you want to get wasted now?").

However, as recompense for our quiet cultural suffering on Hydra, we returned to Poros to see our good friend Dan pulling into port on a ferry from Athens. He had just arrived from New York and was beginning his own tour of the Balkans and central Europe by joining us in Greece. Dan had somehow been convinced that there were "no more seats in coach" on his ferry and he would have to spring the extra €9 for "business class," and as the sun set behind the Hellenic Seaways Flying Cat 1, there was Dan waving from the business class deck, the only passenger in business class sporting a beard and an internal frame backpack. We would only spend one more night and day on Poros before returning to Athens. But the next day, our last day, contained one of the more successful minor adventures of the trip. We woke up relatively early to spend the day at Russian Bay before our evening ferry departed. As we were walking along the road from our house we noticed several extraordinarily large yachts anchored close in to shore. One, sporting a British flag, looked to be the size of a medium warship. In Russian Bay, there was a smaller, but still quite enormous yacht (probably 130 feet), flying an American flag. Dan and I were swimming past it on our way to explore a small island in the middle of Russian Bay and Dan suggested we try to say hello and see if they'd be interested in having us on board. After all we were on vacation and so, very evidently, were these guys. Who doesn't like to meet people and have a little adventure on vacation? Dan and I called out in our friendliest voices and from about 50 feet above us a head appeared over the deck railing, glanced at the two sunburnt men smiling in the water, and returned back to whatever Xanadu it had momentarily been distracted from. 

We had been rejected, unsurprisingly, and slowly swam out to the island as originally planned swallowing the bitter conventional wisdom of exclusion that would not even be suspended here on this really exceptional vacation. Of course we would not be welcomed onto a stranger's massive luxury yacht. But having the obvious confirmed can be depressing. But it can also be comic. As Dan and I were swimming back to the beach from our island, on which we regained equilibrium with a thrilling sun salutation, we heard the unmistakable voice of Heather Gold from somewhere in the vicinity of the unfriendly yacht: 

"Hey are you guys American?"

_Something unintelligible from the yacht._

Danielle, Heather, and Emma were swimming up to the side of the yacht, as Dan and I had half an hour earlier.

"Yeah! We're from New York! Yeah, New York!"

_Again, something unintelligible from the yacht._

"Watch this," Dan said to me, "They're going to get on the yacht." They got on the yacht. Of course three cute girls would be welcomed onto whatever boat in Greece they chose to swim up alongside. The bigger the boat, the more likely they are to get on, probably. So Dan and I laughed at the scene and then sat there treading water, unsure about what to do. We still wanted to go on the yacht. Now that the girls were on board, could we just swim up and ask to join our friends? Or would that be unwelcome and get them kicked off? We debated as we watched the girls take what looked like glasses of champagne from their hosts on the top deck. Dan pointed out that in a just and efficient universe our friends would mention to their hosts that two of their friends were out in the bay treading water, and would it be ok if they came up? That seems so sensible, I agreed with Dan, that it has to happen. So we waited. 

It became clear after a while that Dan and I would have to invite ourselves on board, and so we swam up to the massive yacht, again, but this time explained that our friends were on board. We were promptly invited on, given towels, and led up to the top deck to join Heather, Emma, and Danielle and a group of about five other women and one man, who were clearly the ones in charge of the yacht. We joined the group at the table, were offered some wine, and introduced ourselves. The conversation went pleasantly, with curious silences every now and then. The man introduced himself as Tom. His voice sounded very familiar. Two of the women wore big sunglasses, chain smoked, and didn't say anything. The others told us they were from the states, the South originally, though they lived in LA and New York now for work. At one point, Danielle, picking up on some earlier thread of the conversation that Dan and I had been treading water during, asked "Tom, how long has your radio show been on?" At this moment, I realized I was on [Tom Joyner's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Joyner) yacht.

We couldn't stay long on Tom Joyner's yacht. They had to sail to Athens, and we had to catch the ferry to Athens. Before we jumped off to swim back in to shore, Tom invited us to meet him at a club in Athens that night at midnight. His assistant would email us the details. How exciting, we thought! That was the last time we heard from Tom Joyner.

Back in Athens, we stayed again in Gina's fabulous apartment in Exarhia. We had planned to be in the city for a few days on either side of the election, in the hopes that we would witness some major democratic event. The newspapers told us stakes were high, after all. The fate of the European Union hung on this election. Syriza, the coalition of the radical left, was polling extremely favorably. They had already forced the center-right New Democracy party to a run-off in the May elections. And of course, everyone was wondering about the minor surge in support for the far-right Neo-Nazi party, the Golden Dawn. Constant news coverage of the exploits of the Golden Dawn party served only to heighten the atmosphere of extremity and tension. Golden Dawn MPs had been arrested for joining gangs roaming the streets of Athens and beating up south Asian immigrants. One Golden Dawn supporter had stabbed a communist party volunteer to death outside a voter information booth. And of course, there was [the incendiary incident of Ilias Kasidiaris, a high profile Golden Dawn MP, attacking two female members of parliament from the left on a Greek morning show](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jun/07/golden-dawn-tv-assault-greece) (a 24-hour arrest warrant was issued for Kasidiaris, who had fled the studio, which he easily avoided).

In Athens there were a lot of physical signs of an impending major election. Various parties staffed information tents near the university and in other high traffic areas. Almost every surface in Exarhia was plastered over with posters or political graffiti. And Greeks we met and chatted with would instantly begin discussing the election. However, the city's political temperature was no straightforward to measure. There was a significant element of resignation in the analyses we heard from people around Exarhia. Gina had told me that she didn't really think anything would change with this election, even if Syriza would win. The Euro is over, most people seemed to think, and it doesn't make a difference whether it's over for us now or several months or a year from now. The government in Athens had been so corrupt and inefficient for so long, and the European Union was irrevocably imperialist at its core, that measures to salvage anything from that unholy mess seemed foolish and not worth the effort. On the other hand, people reiterated the feeling that this was a moment of crisis and that something had to be done. The Greeks we talked to were entirely realistic about the fact that their government was broke and could conceivably stop working any day now. Agamemnon (whose judgments seemed a bit extreme) told us he had contingency plans to flee the country if, or when, the government and economy collapse. Other people were not so apocalyptic, but still expressed immediately a feeling of urgency.

And so on election day we waited in Exarhia to see what would happen. It was a quiet, sunny, windy day. Everything was closed as the Greeks went to the polls, and then presumably went home. In the late afternoon, as the polls were closing, Dan and I went out to walk up Lykavitos Hill and to find some groceries for dinner that night. All of the stores were shut and the streets were empty of people and cars. Pairs of police in riot gear lounged on the corners near the border of Exarhia and the more upscale neighborhoods to the north. After walking through a deserted city populated only by the occasional heavily-armored police man, Dan and I came to a surreal sight at the top of Lykavitos Hill. A polished cafe with on a marble deck overlooking the city was bustling with tourists and Greek families. Some cheesy music came from tinny speakers in the rocks around the hilltop. Next to the cafe was a tiny church from the 19th century. Two Greek soldiers were taking down the flag for the day. People were crowding onto the deck around the church to watch the sun set over Athens.

We walked back down into Exarhia and ran into Danielle on the street, out for a stroll. The exit polling numbers were beginning to come in, but it would be a while before anyone had a clear idea of how Greece voted. We went out in search of an open cafe or market for dinner. Most everything was closed. We were walking down a quiet pedestrian street, past a long low wall that was containing some sort of music. Dan stopped and remarked that the music sounded an awful lot like the opening of Hitchcock's _The Lady Vanishes_. We looked at the wall for a minute. There was an opening in it covered by a thick velvet curtain and shortly a man came out and asked us if we would like to see the cinema. Inside was a large courtyard filled with gravel and a screen playing _The Man Who Knew Too Much_. Dan was close. A few people were sitting in plastic chairs watching the film and drinking wine. Next door was an open air cafe, also largely empty. We had found dinner and a movie. We walked excitedly back through the empty streets to retrieve the rest of our group from Gina's. 

At some point as we were getting ready for dinner, someone looked online for election updates and announced that the New Democracy party had won by a slim margin. That was it. The election was over and nothing had happened. Exarhia was still quiet as it had been all day. So we spent election night watching Hitchcock in a vine-covered outdoor cinema. I nodded off during the movie at some point, and after it was over we walked the few blocks back to Gina's apartment and fell asleep. Thus ended our adventures in political crises.
