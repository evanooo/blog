<blockquote>
<p>"The cow is over there," said Ansell, lighting a match and holding it out over the carpet. No one spoke. He waited till the end of the match fell off. Then he spoke again, "She is there, the cow. There, now."</p>
<p>"You have not proved it," said a voice.</p>
<p>"I have proved it to myself."</p>
<p>"I have proved to myself that she isn't," said the voice. "The cow is <em>not</em> there." Ansell frowned and lit another match.</p>
<p>"She's there for me," he declared. "I don't care whether she's there for you or not. Whether I'm in Cambridge or Iceland or dead, the cow will be there."</p>
<p>It was philosophy.</p>
