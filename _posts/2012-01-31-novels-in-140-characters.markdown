![Twitter's newest postmodern voice](/images/cfd1.png)

Advancing the Twitter-as-literature genre by leaps and bounds, the Chicago Fire Department's new Twitter account, [@CFDMedia](https://twitter.com/#!/CFDMedia), has burst onto the scene with a flurry of postmodern tweets that are somewhere between the clipped reports of a police scanner and baffling personal appeals. I think it captures the (non) audience of Twitter perfectly. They also appear to be sent from a BlackBerry. City of Chicago standard issue.

![It's just kind of weird](/images/cfd2.png)

The tweets remind me of Felix Feneon's [_Novels in Three Lines_](http://www.nybooks.com/books/imprints/classics/novels-in-three-lines/), a collection of the several line long news entries Feneon wrote anonymously for _Le Matin_ at the turn of the 20th century. Feneon had a real talent for suggestion, irony, and pathos. For example:

<blockquote>
"A  complaint was sworn by the Persian physician Djai Khan against a compatriot who had stolen from him a tiara."
<br>
<br>
"No more briar pipes. Their makers, in Saint-Claude, have stopped work until they are paid better."
<br>
<br>
""If my candidate loses, I will kill myself," M. Bellavoine, of Fresquienne, Seine-Inferieure, had declared. He killed himself."
</blockquote>

I'm not saying @CFDMedia is like Feneon, and I think the facile Twitter/Novels in Three Lines similarity has been pointed out before, but its worth following this account.
