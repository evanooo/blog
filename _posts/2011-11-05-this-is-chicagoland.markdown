Saw this photo today, titled "Autumn in Chicagoland" --

[David Quinn](http://www.flickr.com/photos/dwquinn79/) took the photo "in the Palatine or Rolling Meadows suburbs" of Chicago. It reminded me immediately of Jason Lazarus's photograph "Standing at the Grave of Emmett Till, Day of Exhumation, June 1st, 2005 (Alsip, IL)" --

I think both photographs capture something uncanny about Chicago's suburban spaces. Both show a scar through manicured, humanless landscapes that look remarkably like backyards. One is a golf course, the other is a cemetery.
