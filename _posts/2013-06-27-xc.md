I drove across the country, from Delaware to Seattle. My route was thus, typically spending one night at each location:

 * Pittsburgh
 * Chicago
 * Sioux City (IA)
 * Badlands (SD)
 * Bighorn National Forest (WY)
 * Gallatin National Forest (MT)
 * Glacier (MT)

For seven years I had been driving between Chicago and Delaware, going out to school or work in the fall and coming home in the summer. I had never driven west of Rockford, Illinois. I knew the lame highways of central-eastern America: the lake counties of Indiana and Ohio, Steel Valley, metro-DC sprawlopolis, and then the creaky stick supports of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge to Delmarva's bean and corn fields and her lesser pine forests shading old railroads. That scenery and speed I knew beyond points of boredom.

So the first three days of the trip -- Pittsburgh, Chicago, and Chicago -- were familiar and lacked the feeling of lighting out for the territory ahead. It wasn't until day four, when I turned off I-90 outside Rockford onto the smaller, [winding US route 20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_20_in_Illinois), that I began to feel I had broken through to America, Points West. I had left Chicago very early that morning, and the streets were still damp from the derecho storms of two days prior. By Rockford, around 9 am, all was dry and the sky was wide open blue, free of clouds. Route 20, the Ulysses S. Grant Memorial Highway, winds through small farms and small towns, along various berms and ridges, until it passes through Galena and then across the Mississippi into Iowa.

My destination that night was a state park outside Sioux City, Iowa, in the northwestern corner of the state, right across the South Dakota line and within five hours of Badlands National Park. That night, under a threatening line of thunderheads that brought down tornados in neighboring Nebraska, I inaugerated what I viewed as the true beginning of my road trip, from which point on I would be sleeping outside each night, and from which point I would be showerless until Glacier, Montana (I stank).

Seen from the interstate, South Dakota is much like Iowa: massive farms, stretching for miles with no treebreaks and few buildings. Desolate high plains roll into desolate high plains, with only the collosal Missouri River crossing to break up the scenery along I-90. Storms are visible from hundreds of miles away, and move with startling quickness across a prostrate landscape. And then, out of a flatness whose gentle rolls only magnify the flatness, a pale serration extends out of one of the gentle green rolls. And then more of these serrations appear in the landscape to the south of the highway, like great reptilian backbones in the soft grass. These are the outskirts of the Badlands.

I spent the night in the national park, at a campground in the "south unit". Night two sleeping in the wild. At 4:45 the next morning I woke up to the din of the plains birds. I had slept without the fly on and saw a bright sky through the mesh netting of my tent. The sun was still below the edge of the horizon and in the east, over the tremendous increasing glow of the yet-to-wake sun, a thunderstorm towered. The scalloped underside of the storm was lit electric red by the rising sun, and the purple thunderhead above its woven neon floor would flash with lightning every few seconds like a struck, electric drum skin.

Several bison walked by and the storm arrived over the campground. I packed quickly, bid goodbye to the friends I had made the night before, and drove through the violent rain into Rapid City. I was approaching the western edge of the Great Plains.

But the West, if that's what I was driving towards, imagining ever since Chicago that I would crest some hill on the interstate and there it would be: mountains, wild painted desert, bighorn sheep, like there was a border somewhere between Iowa and Wyoming with the dull, safe working fields of the eastern half of the country falling suddenly away to the vivid splendors of the forever wild, this imagined West I had not crossed into yet. And ultimately, of course, there was no such border, just a gradual crossing from east to west.

When I tell people on the west coast that I'm from the east, there are typically two reactions in sequence: first a look of pity for me, the poor refugee who somehow made it to asylum, and then of slight apprehension as they realize they're standing next to a wild animal who is too indelicate for their western paradise. There is something so Edenic about the American West's self-conception (and about its reality), that visiting or living in it is like being among those who have finally come out of an exile since birth, returning to the lost original paradise. Somehow the west coasters have undone the fall of man, just don't tell the other humans lest they come and ruin Eden again.
