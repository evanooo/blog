title: Snow!

Last night, Cambridge got its once-annual snowstorm. This morning the town was covered in a half-foot of snow and everyone was out and about with cameras to capture the scene. It was very pretty.

Parker's Piece in Cambridge is like the Midway Plaisance in Hyde Park. A wide open, windblown green space that some poor souls have to trek across daily. There was a joke that Satan was at the end of the Midway, [blasting it with the cold wind from his wings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dante's_Satan). Parker's Piece kind of feels like that.

As counterpoint, and also because it is obligatory when photographing Cambridge, here is a picture of King's Chapel.

Next, we snuck into St. John's back quad. It was a very pretty scene, despite the snow phallus some mature undergrads had constructed. Perhaps the ghosts that supposedly haunt this bridge will teach those kids a lesson.

During World War II, the story goes, Hitler chose not to bomb Cambridge because he so adored this building. I'm almost certain the tale is totally spurious, but there _is_ a pretty fierce looking eagle above the building's main portal. Fishy.

And here we all are, a little dehydrated and tired, but happy at the end of our trek.
