title: February 23, 1939 at the Moral Sciences Club
---

It's only very occasionally that one comes across a real gem while doing archival research. Usually, archival material gives up its secrets slowly and piecemeal. But I found this entry the other day while going through the old minute books of the Moral Sciences Club, a philosophy society at Cambridge where presenters deliver a short paper, usually ten minutes, and then discuss with the other members for a few hours. From 1920 to 1950, a lot of exciting papers were given at the MSC by the likes of G. E. Moore, J. M. Keynes, H. L. A. Hart, John Wisdom, and Ludwig Wittgenstein. 

On the evening of February 23rd, 1939, Wittgenstein opened a general discussion with the question "Why do philosophers ask what is the meaning of a word? Is it because they have forgotten?" In the discussion that followed, the familiar claim that the meaning of a word can be found in its use came up. The "meaning-as-use" thesis is often considered one of the principle themes in Wittgenstein's philosophy, and is sometimes treated as if it had the status of _doctrine_ in his later philosophy. Wittgenstein's remarks on February 23rd make clear that no such interpretation of meaning-as-use can hold. A description of the use of a word itself always has a particular use, and thus ironically defeats any claims that trot out the phenomenon as a thesis. "Philosophical investigations are tedious and difficult, and slip the memory. Slogans are easy, and stick in the memory. If the _use_ goes but the slogan remains, it is _ridiculous_," Wittgenstein reportedly said.

6th Meeting
				
Feb 23rd, 1939

&#42;Doctor L. Wittgenstein

The sixth meeting of the term was held in Mr Smythies rooms in King’s. The Secretary was in the chair. There were two guests, Dr Ewing and Mr Braithwaite. Dr Wittgenstein spoke for a short time by way of opening the discussion. He put this question to those present: “Why do philosophers ask ‘what is the meaning of a word’, (a most common word)? ‘Have they forgotten the meaning of the term, etc.?

Doctor Ewing thought the most important cases in which philosophers ask for the use of a word are cases in which they are doing something other than what they think they are doing, e.g., the case of physical objects. Mr Strachey suggested they were asking for definitions or at least trying to find out whether there can be a definition. Mr Braithwaite said he thought the philosopher was in a sense asking for an explicit description of the behavior of using the word.

Dr Wittgenstein then asked how a definition acts as a coherent account of the use of a word. He said one might say that a definition draws together the usages of words. Augustine when he asks for the meaning of a word collects usages of the word. He reminds himself. If a definition is an account of the meaning isn’t it queer that people should forget it (Prince [referring to the previous week’s meeting, delivered by Mr D. Prince, titled “The use of a word”]), for surely a definition is a very simple thing?

Dr Wittgenstein then asked what would be taken as the necessary qualifications for a definition to be an attempt at a coherent account of the use of a word. Must there not be a technique of working with symbols so that the definition seems to show the exact position of the word in question with respect to all these symbols. Suppose one defined number as Frege did, has one given a full account of the use of ‘number’ or ‘one’? No, there are actual uses of numbers which are not accounted for by it, e.g. counting people. Definition is one peculiar account of the use of the word. Only if you’ve mastered the technique of the language will you learn the word from the definition. In this sense a coherent account is not given by a definition.

Take the case of a physical object. Is it possible to define ‘cap’ by means of sense-data? Dr W thought it quite easy, but that it leads nowhere.
Why do we want a coherent account at all? Philosophers only ask about certain words. Mr Braithwaite: They ask about words which are typical of a certain group, e.g. ‘table’, which is typical of a certain group. Dr W: Yes: but another thing is true, viz. if they do ask and they want a definition, they do not want the most natural definition, e.g. of ‘chair’ they don’t want the definition ‘something to sit on’. Why are they not satisfied with the normal definition of chair, or, to put the ma question in another way, why do they wish to ask for the definition of a physical object?

Mr Earle suggested they wanted to define it in terms of philosophers’ words.

Dr W asked whether one might say that the philosopher wanted to describe the relation between one type of word and another type of word.

Partly.

St. Augustine found it so immensely difficult to find out what time was. What did he want to find out about time? Someone might say that St. Augustine was not puzzled about the usage of the word ‘time’, which is something pedestrian, but was puzzled about the essence of time which does not seem so pedestrian. Why was he puzzled?

Mr Rush Rhees said puzzlement often occurred when there was a conflict of uses. Dr W: this is often called a contradiction. He cited a passage from Hertz’s Principles of Mechanics, in which the latter said that people ask about the essence of matter, etc., because a lot of defining criteria have been heaped on these notions, and these criteria are in conflict. This irritates our mind, and makes us ask ‘what is the essence of so and so?’ The answer is not given by giving further criteria, but by giving less [sic] criteria. When these contradictions are avoided, the question is not answered, but the mind no longer perplexed ceases to ask it. Dr W said he must confess that this passage seemed to him to sum up philosophy.

Nothing is more characteristic of philosophy than to ask oneself the same question a thousand times. One case is that a person never stops doing this. Another case is that a person stops. What is given to him you to make it stop? Sometimes a new analogy, which replaces an old analogy.
He had often pointed out that a child is perplexed when a word is seen to have two different meanings. If this is to cease to be puzzling it must be surrounded by other cases.

Dr W then went back to last week’s discussion:

In a vast number of cases it is possible to replace ‘the meaning of a word’ by ‘the use of a word.’ In what way is this useful. Mr Lewy: It may get rid of the idea that meaning is a picture attached to a word. Dr W: How does [sic] the use and the picture hang together? Isn’t there an entirely parallel connexion, viz. between ostensive definition and use? Suppose I ask: What is a zebra? Does someone’s pointing to a picture of a zebra involve that he uses the word ‘zebra’ as we do? The connexion of image or picture and use is that as a matter of fact in an enormous number of cases to one particular image corresponds one particular use, and where it does _not_, which is also an immense number of cases, there puzzlement arises. Why is it in a great number of cases useful to ask for the use and not the meaning? Because _meaning_ suggests one object, whereas use suggests a number of objects spread out in time.

“In a great number of cases it is advisable to put ‘use of a word’ for ‘meaning of a word’”, is a slogan. Sometimes it is ridiculed: sometimes it is boosted. Both wrongly. If one does philosophy it is natural one should come to certain sorts of step which is advisable to take. Philosophical investigations are tedious and difficult, and slip the memory. Slogans are easy, and stick in the memory. If the _use_ goes but the slogan remains, it is _ridiculous_. Dr W said that although he had often used the words of the slogan, he had never had need to call it anything.

It is a colossally important fact that all objects around us have _one_ name. What is this a principle of?
