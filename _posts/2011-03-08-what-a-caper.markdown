title: What a Caper
---

As Scott [has already put it](http://scottvdp.com/2011/03/08/introducing-chicago2011-org/), after a whirlwind six days, an excellent team of most righteous dudes - Harper Reed, Dylan Richard, Scott VanDenPlas, Aaron Salmon, and Scott Robbin - put together a great site for Rahm's transition team. In record time, they conceptualized, wrote, tested, and finally overcame a most inopportune App Engine fail to launch __[Chicago2011.org](http://www.chicago2011.org)__ to a [warm reception](http://www.chicago2011.org/blog/statement-from-david-hoffman-on-this-site).

It was a great experience and I'm grateful for the opportunity to have worked with such excellent people. And, importantly, Chicago2011.org is doing quite well. We've had a good number of visitors so far, and users have submitted [some pretty excellent](http://www.chicago2011.org/issues/fiscally-sound-government/) proposals on the Interact tool.

I'll be excited to keep working on this project and seeing how far it can go.
