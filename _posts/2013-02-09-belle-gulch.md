From ["Detroit, the Billionaires Playground," _New York Times_, Feb 7, 2013](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/08/opinion/detroit-sinks-with-belle-isle.html), a (short) story of economic recovery, economic inequality, and libertarian dreams riding high atop big-government bailouts.

[Belle Isle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belle_Isle_Park) is an iconic island park managed by the City of Detroit. Designed in the late 1880s by Frederick Law Olmsted -- the man who brought you Central Park and the World's Fair -- the beloved public space is now too expensive for the city to keep up, and consequently at risk of sinking forever into the Detroit River.

But fear not, a group of civic-minded business barons have offered to generously save Belle Isle:

<blockquote>
	<p>Belle Isle was recently at the center of a different moneymaking scheme. A group of wealthy libertarians suggested that private investors buy the island from the city for the nice, round, Dr. Evil-ish sum of $1 billion and transform it into an independent, self-governing territory. With the price for citizenship set at $300,000, the Commonwealth of Belle Isle would exist as a sort of free-market paradise; within 30 years, the group’s Web site predicted, the island would be known as the " 'Midwest Tiger,' rivaling Singapore as an economic miracle." One can order from that Web site a novella about this future Belle Isle, which describes the commonwealth’s low taxes, minimal government, even its own currency (called — seriously — "the Rand").</p>
