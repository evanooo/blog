title: Bildungsbürgertum

I'm not sure how I feel about how people use the word "hipster" -- it seems to be a pretty essentialist pejorative that has a lot of dangers lurking behind it -- but I think often when people use the word they are actually referring to a complex and deep historical phenomenon of the European middle-class. Maybe we're better off using the word <em>Bildungsbürgertum</em>?

<blockquote>The concrete sociopolitical embodiment of the idea of a self-regulating aesthetic society was the so called <em>Bildungsbürgertum</em>, the "educated middle classes," who, although excluded from the exercise of serious forms of independent political power virtually everywhere, used their purported possession of a cultivated faculty of aesthetic judgment, their taste, to legitimize the retention of a certain socially privileged postion. Membership in this group, the <em>Bildungsbürgertum</em>, was not supposed to be guaranteed by noble birth, inherited wealth, or economic success, but was to be granted by the free recognition of one's (good) taste on the part of others who were themselves in a postion to judge. The <em>Bildungsbürgertum</em> was a self-coopting group whose collective good taste was a tacit warrant (almost) of moral superiority. (Raymond Geuss, <em><a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/26127994/Geuss-Kultur-Bildung-Geist">Kultur, Bildung, Geist</a></em>)</blockquote>

It might be a good idea to take note of the <em>Bildungsbürgertum</em> and the history of the aesthetics of the middle-class since we have the 19th century European middle-class to thank for a number of things: from museums to kitsch. Just sayin', if we're going to pass judgement on something, let's make sure we know what exactly it is first.
