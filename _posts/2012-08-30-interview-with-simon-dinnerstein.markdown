title: An interview with Simon Dinnerstein 
---

My dear friend [Katie](http://kaitlinpomerantz.weebly.com/) interviewed artist Simon Dinnerstein recently. [They talked about Dinnerstein's monumental "Fulbright Triptych" (1971-4, see below), the purpose and process of making a piece of art, the figurative tradition, and conventions and criticism.](http://bombsite.com/issues/1000/articles/6754)

It is really an affirming conversation. For example:

<blockquote>
	<p><strong>SD</strong> ...Someone mentioned recently that this painting is sort of like “a geography of the unconscious,” and I really like that expression. But the thing also about this is that it doesn’t have a strategy. In other words, it’s something that just kind of happened. And I think that art that has a strategy, you will know that it has a strategy, and it depletes the art.</p>
	<p><strong>KP</strong> Can you talk more about that? Are you talking about a gimmick?</p>
	<p><strong>SD</strong> Well, I mean work that has a cunning about it, a canniness—work that was figured out before it was begun. I think that undercuts the art. Really important art—whether it’s literature, or dance, or music, or painting, or drawing—it really happens. It doesn’t have a strategy, and I think sometimes you can tell if the art is natural or if it has a kind of agenda.</p>
