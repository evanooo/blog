title: Moving this blog

To add to the large collection of posts praising the move from WordPress to [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki): I moved my blog from WordPress to Jekyll today. I'm a very slow worker, a ruminator (as my mom tells me), prone to idiotic syntax errors, and it still only took me a few hours to install Jekyll, build some templates, and migrate my old stuff. Now, this blog is flying free courtesy of GitHub and Jekyll.

Why did I switch platforms? Mostly because I wanted to learn something new. GitHub is an incredibly useful tool, and I wanted to familiarize myself with the workflow of versioning, testing locally, and deploying that more applications-oriented development requires. Using Jekyll is actually a great introduction to git and GitHub.

The student's perspective aside, what is the advantage of Jekyll over WordPress? Well, for my needs I prefer Jekyll's smaller size, more intuitive templating process, and simple layout. I have to prepare myself each time I start a new WordPress project and begin contorting the default theme to my needs. Perhaps my approach is all wrong, but I end up wading through and cutting loose most of what WordPress prepackages when I make the relatively simple sites I do.

Jekyll doesn't break down the main page into six (or seven?) component PHP files or anything like that. You have your default page template, which lets you put, in plain old HTML, whatever you'd like around your content, and you have your post template, which lets you add HTML or dynamic elements you'd like into your individual posts. Jekyll is basically a text to HTML engine, so the idea is to configure how you'd like your posts to be HTMLed.

Herein lies the benefit and limit of Jekyll when compared to WordPress. WordPress is extremely extendable, can handle multiple different types of content, and has a very nice off-the-shelf backend. It is an extremely capable CMS, but may be a bit too hefty for a simple little blog. It's way bigger than Jekyll, which makes it more versatile, but a little less useable for simple applications like this one.

I still think WordPress is great. It's amazing software. And free! And everyone uses it, so there are tons of neat WP things out there, as well as lots of excellent documentation and support. But, for those of you just blogging, and who are not into Tumblr, Posterous, Blogspot, etc., give Jekyll a try.

To get Jekyll going for free on GitHub, you'll need to know HTML, CSS, and a little bit of [Git](http://git-scm.com/). They're all worth learning.
