title: Cross-category equivocation
---

In [James Conant's](http://philosophy.uchicago.edu/faculty/conant.html) essay on types of philosophical nonsense in Wittgenstein's _Tractatus_ and Rudolf Carnap's writing, he lists several newspaper headlines as examples of "cross-category equivocation," or examples of sentences whose words have multiple meanings and aren't clear about which meaning they mean. Forget the philosophical relevance of these, I just think they're funny to read:

 * British Left Waffles on Falkland Islands
 * British Push Bottles Up German Rear
 * Potential Witness to Murder Drunk
 * Legal Aid Advocates Worry
 * Crowds Rushing To See Pope Trample 6 to Death
 * Beating Witness Provides Names
 * Nixon Stands Pat on Watergate Tapes
 * University Studies Mushroom
 * Carter Plans Swell Deficit

<br>

It's good to see that philosophers are keeping track of things like this.
