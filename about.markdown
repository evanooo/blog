###About Me###

I'm a 26 year old from Lewes, Delaware.

I recently completed my MPhil in Political Thought and Intellectual History at the University of Cambridge. My dissertation, titled "Wittgenstein, Moore, and Moore's Paradox," examined the contexts of different philosophies of logic and language between the early and later Wittgenstein, and brought these findings to bear on contemporary debates between so-called resolute and standard readings of Wittgenstein's _Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus_.

I did my AB at the University of Chicago in a program called [Fundamentals](http://fundamentals.uchicago.edu/Welcome.html), administered by Leo Strauss's ghost.

After that I paid the rent with politics. I worked for the admirable Forrest Claypool, and on Rahm Emanuel's mayoral campaign and transition team.

Before all of that I worked in Sarajevo as an intern reporting for the [Balkan Investigative Reporting Network](http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/page/all-balkans-home).

I'm interested in the importance of narratives, and like to get outside when I can. My favorite book is Moby Dick, which William Faulkner read once a year.

Everything I didn't copy and paste, I wrote by hand on a 13" MacBook using TextWrangler.
