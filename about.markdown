<h3>About Me</h3>

I'm a 25 year old from Lewes, Delaware.

I went to the University of Chicago and majored in a program called [Fundamentals](http://fundamentals.uchicago.edu/Welcome.html), administered by Leo Strauss's ghost.

Recently I've been paying the rent with politics. I worked for the admirable Forrest Claypool and just finished as a staffer on Rahm Emanuel's transition team.

Before all of that I worked in Sarajevo as an intern reporting for the [Balkan Investigative Reporting Network](http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/page/all-balkans-home).

I'll be heading across the pond to Cambridge this fall to study for an MPhil in Political Thought and Intellectual History.

I'm interested in the importance of narratives, and like to get outside when I can. My favorite book is Moby Dick, which William Faulkner read once a year.

<h3>About this site</h3>

This blog is run on [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll). I learned what to put where by browsing [this dude's source](https://github.com/harperreed/harperreed-blog).

Everything I didn't copy and paste, I wrote by hand on a 13" MacBook using TextWrangler.

The fonts are Bell Gothic Black (available courtesy of [Cufon](http://cufon.shoqolate.com/generate/), Helvetica, and Georgia.
