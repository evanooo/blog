###About Me###

I'm a 26 year old from Lewes, Delaware.

I'm currently a student at the University of Cambridge in the political thought and intellectual history program. I'm researching how linguistic philosophies have complicated the historian's task, and what sort of redemption linguistic philosophy and history offer each other.

I did my BA at the University of Chicago in a program called [Fundamentals](http://fundamentals.uchicago.edu/Welcome.html), administered by Leo Strauss's ghost.

After that I paid the rent with politics. I worked for the admirable Forrest Claypool and recently finished as a staffer on Rahm Emanuel's transition team.

Before all of that I worked in Sarajevo as an intern reporting for the [Balkan Investigative Reporting Network](http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/page/all-balkans-home).

I'm interested in the importance of narratives, and like to get outside when I can. My favorite book is Moby Dick, which William Faulkner read once a year.

###About this site###

This blog is run on [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll). I learned what to put where by browsing [this dude's source](https://github.com/harperreed/harperreed-blog).

Everything I didn't copy and paste, I wrote by hand on a 13" MacBook using TextWrangler.

The fonts are Bell Gothic (available courtesy of [Cufon](http://cufon.shoqolate.com/generate/)), Helvetica, and Georgia.
