		<p>Two days ago, the New York Times published an op-ed by Ta-Nehisi Coates called <a href='http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/07/opinion/coates-the-good-racist-people.html'>&#8220;The Good, Racist People&#8221;</a>. In it, Coates takes up the recent harassment of actor Forest Whitaker at a deli in Morningside Heights as an illustration of the almost invisible form that racism has taken in 21st century America. While waiting in line, Whitaker was approached by an employee of the deli, accused of shoplifting, and then frisked. The Oscar-winning actor had of course not shoplifted from the store (but someone else had), and upon realizing this the mortified employee quickly apologized for his &#8220;sincere mistake.&#8221;</p>

<p>Coates notes that the employee probably did make a <em>sincere</em> mistake and is most likely a &#8220;decent man,&#8221; as the deli owner and other people who know him have claimed. He probably did genuinely think Whitaker was a thief. Indeed, we have no reason to suspect that the employee harbors any sort of active discrimination towards people of color. At the very most, we can fault the transgressor with having internalized some sort of subconscious discriminatory suspicion and fear of black people. This is no trivial point. A country in which every black person is a suspect, even those we see on TV and in movies every day, is a country that is existentially hostile to a significant portion of its population.</p>

<p>But I don&#8217;t think this is the only point that Coates is making. He is also concerned with exploring the contradiction of being both this kind of unwitting racist and also a &#8220;decent man.&#8221; After all, Coates admits, the deli employee is both. And he wonders out loud, going through a list of similar micro-aggressions (a black president required to prove he was really born in America, whites keeping blacks out of their neighborhoods and claiming in total sincerity that they are not racist), why this contradiction is at all tolerable in our nominally anti-racist society.</p>

<p>Well, I can venture one guess as to why this contradiction is not just tolerable, but so unremarkable that we discuss it only when a victim of hidden racism publishes an eloquent op-ed in the NYT: we don&#8217;t have a robust concept of equality in our current political conversation.</p>

<p>It may seem odd to claim that Americans aren&#8217;t really concerned with equality in the days when the LGBTQ rights movement is at the peak of a shockingly rapid ascent and <a href='http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/news/2012/03/05/11193/americans-care-about-economic-inequality'>a majority of Americans think economic inequality is the greatest obstacle to social mobility.</a> But I mean that we don&#8217;t have a <em>robust</em> concept of equality. Although a majority of Americans may be concerned about economic inequality and favor equality of rights for minorities, there is little discussion that connects economic inequalities with individual instances of prejudice. So long as these two forms of inequality &#8211; one structural, the other personal &#8211; are seen as separate and unrelated, we won&#8217;t have a coherent idea of social inequality that can be used in the service of political action. So long as we understand the Whitaker affair as a case of a decent man making a sincere mistake, we have no problem to attack, no cause to address to ensure that decent men no longer make these kind of deeply damaging mistakes. Mistakes which Coates is right to point out effectively tell black children &#8220;We were never meant to be part of the American story&#8230;Don&#8217;t leave home. They don&#8217;t want you around.&#8221;</p>

<p>Walter Benn Michaels has <a href='http://www.lrb.co.uk/v31/n16/walter-benn-michaels/what-matters'>an excellent article in the LRB</a> that explores how neoliberalism has effectively transformed the discussion of inequality in a discussion of prejudice, thus deflating any political animus to address the root causes of social and political differences that occur along race, gender, and class lines. I believe when Benn Michaels examines how the US could become more anti-racist and anti-sexist in the past 40 years, while at the same time become massively more unequal along racial and gender lines, he is analyzing the phenomenon that Coates feels in the instance of the Forest Whitaker&#8217;s insult.</p>

<p>From Benn Michaels:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>That is, once you start redefining the problem of class difference as the problem of class prejudice – once you complete the transformation of race, gender and class into racism, sexism and classism – you no longer have to worry about the redistribution of wealth. You can just fight over whether poor people should be treated with contempt or respect. And while, in human terms, respect seems the right way to go, politically it's just as empty as contempt.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And from Coates:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>The other day I walked past this particular deli. I believe its owners to be good people. I felt ashamed at withholding business for something far beyond the merchant's reach. I mentioned this to my wife. My wife is not like me. When she was 6, a little white boy called her cousin a nigger, and it has been war ever since. “What if they did that to your son?” she asked.</p>
	<p>And right then I knew that I was tired of good people, that I had had all the good people I could take.</p>
