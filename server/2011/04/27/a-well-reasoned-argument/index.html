What follows is an email I received from a dear roommate continuing a conversation the apartment had been having earlier in the day about whether or not to throw a party (we were in college at the time). I found it buried in my inbox today. It remains to this day one of the finer examples of argumentation I have seen, and in its spirit, I would even compare it <a href='https://www.msu.edu/~tyrrell/LYSIAS.htm' target='_blank'>Lysias's funeral oration</a>.

After careful consideration, I think it is very important that<br />
we throw a raging kegger.  These being the final days of our<br />
formative years, the opportunities to get wildly drunk and act<br />
with utter disregard and abandon will be fewer and fewer<br />
until, god forbid, we become respectable people.  Further, it<br />
is commonly known that the typical Uchicago party is wanting<br />
in spirit and verve; by throwing a raging kegger we can buck<br />
this pervasive and unhealthy trend.  I have been to many<br />
parties where people were simply too sober and, though I<br />
enjoyed the party, I came away thinking that it would be<br />
really great if everyone were just a bit crazier and yes,<br />
sloppier.</p><p>
I think a keg is important for facilitating the atmosphere<br />
necessary for a raging kegger.  Kegs are also cheaper than a<br />
comparable quantity of cans or bottles.  Most people prefer<br />
draft beer to other sorts of beer.  While its true, kegs are a<br />
hassle, the increased effort will be worth the cost</p><p>
Beer pong is also an important aspect of a raging kegger.  I<br />
know that it is not in vogue on our campus.  In fact, a great<br />
stigma seems to be attached towards the activity.  However,<br />
beer pong is a fun activity that encourages a friendly spirit<br />
of competition.  Yes, beer pong is messy, but parties are<br />
generally messy (even if they're not raging keggers).  Our<br />
floors need a good mopping anyway; we should resolve to mop<br />
Sunday afternoon regardless of how messy the party gets.</p><p>
I understand that a raging kegger may seem garrulous and<br />
fratty.  However, considering our well known and well defined<br />
personalities combined with our equally well established<br />
credentials as non-frat people, I suspect most recipients of<br />
the e-mail invitation will understand our conscientious use of<br />
the phrase and find it ironic and entirely consistent with our<br />
personalities and m.o.  Since we will, in fact, be throwing a<br />
raging kegger, we get to have our cake and eat it too.</p><p>
Respectfully disagreeing with ---, I think there is a<br />
difference between BYOB and "contributions welcome."  In my<br />
experience, BYOB is code for "there won't be much alcohol"<br />
while "contributions welcome" has a meaning more akin to: "be<br />
a good person; help us defray the cost of the party."  In<br />
general, there have been far too many potluck style<br />
house-parties lately and not enough instances of old fashioned<br />
hospitality.</p><p>
I welcome discussion on any of the matters above.  I think its [sic]<br />
important we're all together and committed to the vision of<br />
our party, regardless of what that vision ends up being. It<br />
is important we have a clear idea of said vision in the<br />
immediate future so we can get an invite out.  As far as<br />
discussion goes, I think its important that we don't regard a<br />
tame, traditional apartment party as the status quo by which<br />
alternatives (namely the raging kegger) must prove themselves<br />
superior, but rather hold to each option equally rigorous<br />
standards of justification.</p>
