		<p>Last week, I escaped the inter-term somnolence of Cambridge for the brilliance of Istanbul. Tickets purchased only days before, I handed in my paper for the term and rode the train south into London through the rain with a coursemate. We would arrive in Istanbul at 4 am and meet another coursemate who had jumped Cambridge the day before and <a href='http://adelicatething.tumblr.com/'>a good friend of mine traveling and writing in the region.</a> Istanbul is a striking city, even at 4 am and taken in without sleep and wearied by in-flight drinks.</p>

<p><img alt='Sultanahmet at sunset' src='/img/posts/istanbul3.jpg' /></p>

<p>For one, it is enormous. The city is growing tremendously. New highways and metro lines connect the bunches of high-rise apartment blocks stretching west of the old city. The metropolitan area extends in all directions and technically encompasses (and administers) areas as far from historic walls of the city as the Prince&#8217;s Islands, 20 km southwest of the central neighborhood of Sultanahmet in the Sea of Marmara. We stayed in a wonderful hostel in Beyoğlu, a populous neighborhood across the Golden Horn from the tourist-laden Sultanahmet. The main pedestrian drag, Istiklal, was packed with people every night. On our second night, the local football team, Galatasaray, beat Fenerbahçe, a team from across town. Istiklal was quickly filled with fans who were mostly content to parade down the street. Things got tense briefly when a Galatasaray supporter noticed an unfortunate kid wearing a Fenerbahçe jersey and rushed at him. To the credit of Galatasaray fans, several Galatasaray supporters intervened and whisked the Fenerbahçe kid (probably 12 years old) into the back of a nearby shop where the crowd couldn&#8217;t get at him.</p>

<p><img alt='Galatasaray wins' src='/img/posts/istanbul9.jpg' /></p>

<p>Our merry band of four travelers initially did a good job seeing the sights. We spent a sunny afternoon in Sultanahmet, visiting the Blue Mosque, Haghia Sofia, and Topkapi Palace (though we <em>twice</em> missed the museum&#8217;s opening hours). A was excited to have the chance to pray in some of Istanbul&#8217;s many, breath-taking mosques. We non-faithful were happy to sit outside and enjoy the sights.</p>

<p>The Haghia Sofia (Ayasofia) was really quite strange. It&#8217;s ancient, and feels like it. The building has been added to over the years, accumulating new wings, minarets, and flying buttresses as empires changed and the building grew beyond its original structural capacities. While it is aesthetically coherent, in person you can see the different ages of the various parts of the building, giving its permanence an uncanny countenance. Inside the roof is decorated with Byzantine icons. I took especial note of the four cherubs decorating the pendentives. Cherubs really are quite ghastly creatures: six-winged, four-faced creatures <a href='http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel%201:13&amp;version=NIV'>&#8220;resembling living fire.&#8221;</a> The Ottomans covered the faces of the four Cherubs in the Haghia Sofia, but one has been restored. Tremble:</p>

<p>We also happened to pay a visit to the massive Turkish Military Museum on the day the Turkish state commemorates the battle of the Dardanelles. Thus, we scored free admission and had the added cultural benefit of witnessing the considerable number of museum visitors, giving some sense of the meaning of the holiday to contemporary Turks. The museum exhibits consisted mostly of Ottoman-era weaponry and armor. There is also a good amount of space dedicated to the founding of the republic, as one would expect, and a few rooms about Atatürk. There is something like a state-sponsored cult of personality around Atatürk, and I confess I gathered no sense of how this narrative sits with contemporary Turks of any political leaning. I did hear mention of Kemalists, though I do not know how big of a section of the Turkish political spectrum this is, or what their relationship is to the current nationalist government.</p>

<p>Our fearless touring and the just-ended Cambridge term soon caught up with us, however, and we spent a lot of time in Istanbul relaxing in the sun. Many glasses of tea were drunk, several books were read, panoramas were taken in, and lots of games of cards were played. It was a wonderful respite.</p>

<p>You all should go if you can.</p>
